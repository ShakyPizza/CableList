# CableList

## Overview
CableList is a web-based application designed to quickly search through large Excel datasets. The application processes an Excel file (2200+ rows, 10+ columns) into a searchable database using a Flask API (with SQLite/MySQL) and displays results via a responsive React-based user interface. It’s optimized for both desktop and mobile usage.

## Features
- **Excel Upload & Processing:** Convert uploaded Excel files into a database.
- **Search API:** Fast and optimized search endpoints built with Flask.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean and responsive search interface built with React and Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS.
- **Optional Enhancements:** 
  - User authentication (Google Sign-In)
  - CSV export of search results
  - Advanced filters with dropdowns for specific columns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/) for the backend.
- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/) for the frontend.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/search-app.git
cd search-app
```

#### 2. Backend Setup (Flask)
1. **Navigate to the backend folder:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file for your sensitive configurations (e.g., database URI).
5. **Run the Flask App:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The API should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

#### 3. Frontend Setup (React)
1. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. **Install React dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the React Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment
- **Backend:**  
  - Deploy using platforms like [Render](https://render.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).  
  - For production, consider using MySQL/PostgreSQL and containerizing your app with Docker.
- **Frontend:**  
  - Host on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).  
  - Make sure to update the API endpoint URL in your environment variables (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_URL`).

## Optional Enhancements
- **User Authentication:**  
  Integrate Google Sign-In using Firebase or a similar service. Maybe even authenticator for log in.
- **CSV Export:**  
  Implement CSV export functionality using packages like `react-csv`.
- **Advanced Filters:**  
  Enhance the search functionality with dropdown filters for specific columns.
